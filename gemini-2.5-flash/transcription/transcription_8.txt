DOCTOR: Good morning. We're here to discuss your recent laboratory work. Your glycated hemoglobin, or HbA1c, was 8.2%. This confirms a state of persistent hyperglycemia and indicates suboptimal glycemic control over the preceding three months, placing you at higher risk for microvascular complications like retinopathy and nephropathy.
PATIENT: I was afraid of that. I've been experiencing increased polydipsia and significant fatigue. I'm compliant with my Metformin hydrochloride 1000 mg twice daily, I assure you.
DOCTOR: I don't doubt your adherence. However, as the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes progresses, monotherapy often becomes insufficient. We need a more aggressive strategy for glycemic management. I'm considering adding a second agent. We have several classes to choose from. A DPP4 inhibitor, like sitagliptin or linagliptin, is one option. Another is an SGLT2 inhibitor, such as empagliflozin or dapagliflozin, which works by inducing glycosuria. Given your risk profile, an SGLT2 inhibitor offers cardiovascular benefits.
PATIENT: So, another medication on top of the Metformin?
DOCTOR: Yes, this will be a combination therapy. Before we initiate treatment, I'll need to check your baseline renal function, via an eGFR. I'm also referring you for medical nutrition therapy with our certified diabetic educator to discuss advanced carbohydrate counting and glycemic load. This is a crucial component of your treatment matrix.
PATIENT: Okay, I'm willing to try it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We will reevaluate your fasting plasma glucose, postprandial levels, and repeat the HbA1c in three months. Please continue your self-monitoring of blood glucose and report any episodes of hypoglycemia immediately.
