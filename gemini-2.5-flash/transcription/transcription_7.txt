Patient: You mentioned these headaches have a very specific pattern. Could you walk me through a typical episode from start to finish?
Patient: It's awful.
Patient: Before the pain starts, my vision gets strange. I see shimmering, jagged lines, sometimes a blind spot.
Patient: That lasts for about twenty minutes.
Patient: Then the headache hits. It's a severe, pulsating pain always on the left side of my head.
Patient: Any light or sound is unbearable.
Doctor: That presentation with the transient visual scotomas and scintillations preceding a unilateral, pulsating cephalalgia, accompanied by phonophobia and photophobia, is the classic presentation of migraine with aura.
Doctor: Your neurologic exam today is non-focal, which is reassuring. It helps us rule out more sinister causes.
Patient: I just want them to stop. What can I do?
Doctor: For managing the acute attacks, I'm prescribing Sumatriptan. It's a triptan, a class of drug that is very effective at aborting a migraine.
Doctor: If these attacks become more frequent, we can discuss prophylactic therapy, perhaps with a medication like Topiramate.
Doctor: I also want you to keep a detailed headache diary to help identify potential triggers.
Patient: Okay.
Patient: A diary and Sumatriptan.
Doctor: Yes. Let's schedule a follow-up in six weeks to see how the abortive therapy is working for you and to review your diary.
