Original Ground Truth:
Doctor: Thank you for coming in. I know this can be a difficult step. Can you elaborate on the nature of the worry you've been experiencing?

Patient: It's unremitting and pervasive. I have free-floating anxiety about my career, finances, health... I recognize it's disproportionate, but I can't attenuate the thought patterns. I also have psychomotor agitation, an inability to concentrate, and significant somatic tension in my shoulders and neck. This has been ongoing for nearly a year.

Doctor: The symptomatology you describe—including excessive, uncontrollable worry across multiple domains for over six months, accompanied by somatic and cognitive symptoms—is highly consistent with the DSM-5 criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).

Patient: So it's a formal diagnosis? I'm not just being neurotic?

Doctor: It is a well-defined and treatable neurobiological condition. The gold-standard treatment involves a dual approach of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. I strongly recommend Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Concurrently, we can initiate a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI. Options include Escitalopram, Sertraline, or Paroxetine. An SNRI like Venlafaxine is also a valid alternative.

Patient: I'm willing to consider medication. I need to function again.

Doctor: That is the therapeutic goal. We will start with a low dose of Sertraline 25mg and titrate up slowly to mitigate initial adverse effects. It's important to know that therapeutic onset can take four to six weeks. I am also providing you with a referral to a psychologist specializing in CBT. We will schedule a follow-up in four weeks to assess tolerability and initial response.
