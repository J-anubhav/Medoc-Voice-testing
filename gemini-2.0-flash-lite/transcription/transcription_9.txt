Doctor: Please describe the ocular irritation you've been experiencing.
Patient: My eyes have a persistent foreign body sensation. Towards the end of the day, they feel gritty and burn, especially during sustained reading or computer use, and my vision gets blurry until I blink several times.
Doctor: Your symptomatology is pathognomonic for keratoconjunctivitis sicca or dry eye syndrome. It's often exacerbated by reduced blink rates during tasks requiring high visual concentration.
Doctor: This leads to tear film instability, ocular surface inflammation, and hyperosmolarity.
Patient: That sounds complex. What's the treatment?
Doctor: Initially, we will start with aggressive ocular lubrication. I want you to use preservative-free artificial tears, specifically a lipid-based formulation like sustain complete or refresh optic mega-3, at least 4 to 6 times daily to address potential meibomian gland dysfunction.
Doctor: Also, rigorously adhere to the 20-20-20 rule to mitigate computer vision syndrome.
Patient: Lipid-based tears and the 20-20-20 rule. Got it.
Doctor: Correct. If your symptoms are refractory to these conservative measures after a month, we will proceed with further diagnostics, possibly a Schirmer's test or tear film break-up time analysis.
Doctor: At that point, we can escalate to prescription immunomodulatory agent like cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion or lifitegrast ophthalmic solution to increase endogenous tear production.
