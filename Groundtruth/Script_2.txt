Doctor : Good afternoon. Let's review your blood pressure log since you started the lisinopril. How have you been feeling overall?
Patient: Much better, thank you. My readings at home have been consistently around 130 over 85. I do feel a bit lightheaded sometimes when I stand up too quickly, though.
Doctor : That can be a common side effect of an ACE inhibitor as your body adjusts. Your log looks excellent; the medication is effective. We'll maintain the current dosage. I want to continue emphasizing the importance of the DASH diet—low sodium is key. Are you managing at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise most days?
Patient: I've been walking every morning, and I'm really watching my salt intake. It's been a big change.
Doctor : That's the best way to support the medication. Continue monitoring your pressure at home. Let’s do a follow-up in three months. At that time, we'll also draw a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, which is standard procedure with this medication.
Patient: Sounds like a plan. Thank you, doctor.
