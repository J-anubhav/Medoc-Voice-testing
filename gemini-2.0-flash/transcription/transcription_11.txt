Doctor: Thank you for coming in. I know this can be a difficult step. Can you elaborate on the nature of the worry you've been experiencing?
Patient: It's unremitting and pervasive. I have free-floating anxiety about my career, finances, health. I recognize it's disproportionate, but I can't attenuate the thought patterns. I also have psychomotor agitation, an inability to concentrate, and significant somatic tension in my shoulders and neck. This has been ongoing for nearly a year.
Doctor: The symptomatology you describe, including excessive, uncontrollable worry across multiple domains for over six months, accompanied by somatic and cognitive symptoms, is highly consistent with the DSM-5 criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, GAD.
Patient: So, it's a formal diagnosis. I'm not just being neurotic?
Doctor: It is a well-defined and treatable neurobiological condition. The gold standard treatment involves a dual approach of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. I strongly recommend cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT. Concurrently, we can initiate a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI. Options include escitalopram, sertraline, or paroxetine. An SNRI like venlafaxine is also a valid alternative.
Patient: I'm willing to consider medication. I need to function again.
Doctor: That is the therapeutic goal. We will start with a low dose of sertraline 25 milligrams, and titrate up slowly to mitigate initial adverse effects. It's important to note that therapeutic onset can take four to six weeks. I am also providing you with a referral to a psychologist specializing in CBT. We will schedule a follow-up in four weeks to assess tolerability and initial response.
