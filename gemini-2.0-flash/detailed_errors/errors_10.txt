Original Ground Truth:
Doctor: Hello. Tell me what's been happening with Leo.

Patient: It's been very stressful. He had a sustained high-grade fever for three days, peaking around 103.5Â°F. We were using antipyretics. This morning, the fever completely resolved, but he developed this diffuse, pink, spotty rash across his entire trunk and back.

Doctor: Let me examine him. Yes, the clinical presentation is classic. The sequence of high fever followed by abrupt defervescence and the subsequent appearance of a non-pruritic, maculopapular rash is the hallmark of Roseola Infantum, also known as Exanthem Subitum. It's caused by Human Herpesvirus 6.

Patient: Thank goodness. I was worried about measles or something worse. Does he require an antibiotic?

Doctor: No, this is a viral exanthem, and his immune system has already controlled the viremia. The rash is a post-viral manifestation and will resolve spontaneously within 48 hours. Unlike Rubeola, there's no coryza, cough, or Koplik spots. Management is purely supportive: ensure adequate hydration and use paracetamol or ibuprofen as needed for any residual irritability. No follow-up is indicated unless he develops red flag symptoms like lethargy or febrile seizures.

Patient: That is an immense relief. Thank you, doctor.
