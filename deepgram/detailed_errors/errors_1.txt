Original Ground Truth:
Doctor: Good morning. Please describe the symptomatology you've been experiencing.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. For the past three days, I've had this persistent, non-productive cough. It’s coupled with significant odynophagia, a general feeling of asthenia, and a mild frontal cephalalgia. I've also had constant rhinorrhea and a raw pharyngeal discomfort.

Doctor: I see. And what was the temporal progression? Was it an insidious onset or did the symptoms present more abruptly?

Patient: It was quite abrupt. I felt perfectly fine one day and then woke up feeling like this the next.

Doctor: Understood. Your presentation is consistent with a probable acute viral rhinosinusitis, with possible tracheobronchitis. We'll manage this symptomatically. I'm advising pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, which is a sympathomimetic decongestant, along with dextromethorphan hydrobromide to act as an antitussive.

Patient: Okay, that makes sense.

Doctor: For your recovery, ensure you get ample bed rest and maintain high fluid intake with hypotonic solutions. Adhere to a BRAT diet and avoid potential irritants like capsaicin or excessive lipid consumption. Monitor your progress. If the symptoms fail to resolve in the next 7 to 10 days, or if you develop signs of a secondary bacterial infection like purulent discharge or a high-grade fever, you need to return. At that point, we may need to initiate a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen.

Patient: That's very clear. I'll follow those instructions. Thank you, doctor.
