Doctor: thank you for coming in i know this can be a difficult step can you elaborate on the nature of the worry you've been experiencing
Patient: it's unremitting and pervasive i have free floating anxiety about my career finances health i recognize it's disproportionate but i can't attenuate the thought patterns i also have psycho motor agitation an inability to concentrate and significant somatic tension in my shoulders and neck this has been ongoing for nearly a year
Doctor: the symptomatology you describe including excessive uncontrollable worry across multiple domains for over six months accompanied by somatic and cognitive symptoms is highly consistent with the dsm-five criteria for generalized anxiety disorder jad
Patient: so it's a formal diagnosis i'm not just being neurotic
Doctor: it is a well defined and treatable neurobiological condition the gold standard treatment involves a dual approach of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy i strongly recommend cognitive behavioral therapy cbt concurrently we can initiate a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or ssri options include acitalopram sertraline or paroxetine an snri like venlafaxine is also a valid alternative
Patient: i am willing to consider medication i need to function again
Doctor: that is the therapeutic goal we will start with a low dose of sertraline twenty five mg and titrate up slowly to mitigate initial adverse effects it's important to note that therapeutic onset can take four to six weeks i am also providing you with a referral to a psychologist specializing in cbt we will schedule a follow-up in four weeks to assess tolerability and initial response
