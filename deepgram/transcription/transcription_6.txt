Doctor: so you're still having pain in that right knee after the basketball game two weeks ago show me exactly where it hurts it's right here on the inside of my knee it feels like it's catching or locking when i try to bend it all the way and the joint line is very tender to the touch let's examine it i'm going to perform a few maneuvers okay that's a positive mcmurray's test which indicate a meniscal pathology given the location of your pain and that locking sensation i strongly suspect you have a tear of your medial meniscus a tear does that mean i need surgery not necessarily but we need to confirm the diagnosis first i'm ordering an mri of your knee it will give us a clear image of the cartilage in the meantime i want you on a strict rice protocol rest ice compression and elevation you can use an nsaid like ibuprofen for the inflammation avoid any pivoting or high impact activities okay rice protocol and an mri exactly once we have the mri results you'll come back in and we can discuss the findings and determine the best course of action which could range from physical therapy to an arthroscopic repair
