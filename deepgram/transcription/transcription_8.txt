Doctor: good morning we're here to discuss your recent laboratory work your glycated hemoglobin or hba1c was 8.2% this confirms a state of persistent hyperglycemia and indicates suboptimal glycemic control over the preceding three months placing you at higher risk for microvascular complications like retinopathy and nephropathy
Patient: i was afraid of that i've been experiencing increased polydipsia and significant fatigue i'm compliant with my metformin hydrochloride one thousand mg twice daily i assure you
Doctor: i don't doubt your adherence however as the pathophysiology of type two diabetes progresses monotherapy often becomes insufficient we need a more aggressive strategy for glycemic management i'm considering adding a second agent we have several classes to choose from a dpp-four inhibitor like sitagliptin or linagliptin is one option another is an sglt2 inhibitor such as empagliflozin or dpagliflozin which works by inducing glycosuria given your risk profile an sglt2 inhibitor offers cardiovascular benefits
Patient: so another medication on top of the metformin
Doctor: yes this will be a combination therapy before we initiate treatment i'll need to check your baseline renal function via an egfr i'm also referring you for medical nutrition therapy with our certified diabetic educator to discuss advanced carbohydrate counting and glycemic load this is a crucial component of your treatment matrix
Patient: okay i'm willing to try it
Doctor: excellent we will reevaluate your fasting plasma glucose postprandial levels and repeat the hba1c in three months please continue your self monitoring of blood glucose and report any episodes of hypoglycemia immediately
