Doctor: you mentioned these headaches have a very specific pattern could you walk me through a typical episode from start to finish it's awful before the pain starts my vision gets strange i see shimmering jagged lines sometimes a blind spot that lasts for about twenty minutes then the headache hits it's a severe pulsating pain always on the left side of my head any light or sound is that presentation with the transient visual scotomas and scintillations preceding a unilateral pulsating cephalalgia accompanied by phonophobia and photophobia is the classic presentation of migraine with aura your neurologic exam today is non focal which is reassuring it helps us rule out more sinister causes i just want them to stop what can i do for managing the acute attacks i'm prescribing sumatriptan it's a triptan a class of drug that is very effective at aborting a migraine if these attacks become more frequent we can discuss prophylactic therapy perhaps with a medication like topiramate i also want you to keep a detailed headache diary to help identify potential triggers okay a diary and sumatriptan yes let's schedule a follow-up in six weeks to see how the abortive therapy is working for you and to review your diary
